MATLAB TOOLBOX FOR MOTION CAPTURE v1.0
--------------------------------------


Thank you for downloading this toolbox. It is provided as a free web resource 
for educational purposes only. It provides Matlab functions to easily manipulate motion capture data (currently BVH files are supported, and future versions will support ASF and AMC files).


The 3 main functions are:
-------------------------

mocap2matrix - reads the motion capture file to a matrix

displaymocap - displays the motion capture data within Matlab

matrix2mocap - writes the matrix back to a motion capture file
